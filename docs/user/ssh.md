## SSH

**SSH** (Secure Shell) is a technology for safe communication with other machines. SSH module for VMSM allows
you to open terminal and connect directly with your VM.

SSH configuration will ask you about:
* *host address*, which can be either IP or domain address. Address of VM will be used as default value here.
* *username* and *password* - credentials used to log in to remote computer.

After properly configuring SSH module, you can open terminal in main menu (`SSH/Open terminal...`) or via quick menu
button with computer icon.

Now you can write your commands to input and press "Enter". These commands will be sent via SSH to your virtual machine.
Reponse will be printed to output area.
