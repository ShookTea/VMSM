## Troubleshooting

If any error happens during working with VMSM, [create new task on GitHub](https://github.com/ShookTea/VMSM/issues) and
describe it.

Sometimes removing your VMSM config (`.vmsm` directory in your home directory) will solve problems, but remember: you
will loose configuration of all virtual machines added to VMSM and all modules, but it shouldn't affect your VMs.
